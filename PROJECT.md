- Support multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Ensure accurate item detection and price display
- Provide a user-friendly interface for configuration

## Technical Requirements
- OBS Studio plugin development
- Computer vision for item detection
- Integration with Tarkov Market API
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance optimization
